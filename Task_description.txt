Task for Node js:
Build a apis for web application which lets employees of an organization 
to add/manage challenges for internal hackathons which they organize every month. 
Let's call this application Hack Ideas.
The application should have these features,
* Allow users to add them into application with 'employee id',name','age','department'.
* Allow users to enter into application with 'employee id'(password is not necessary).
* Allow users to add a new challenges/ideas.
* Allow users to edit their challenges/ideas.
* A challenge will have a title, description and tags
* You can maintain fixed pre-defined tags (like 'feature', 'tech' etc.)
* Users can upvote a challenge.
* Show the list of all challenges on home page
* Allow users to sort challenges with votes count, creation date


Use MySQL database to store data and to create api you can use express js.

Ans:
Table 1- employee
'employee id','name','password','age','department'.

Table 2- challenge
'employee id','title', 'description', 'tags', 'creation date', 'votes count'.
